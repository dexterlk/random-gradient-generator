# random-gradient-generator
A webpage for generating random gradient backgrounds

## How It Works
- Click the 'Random Gradient' button to generate a new random gradient.
- Click the 'Copy Gradient' button to copy the css property styling for the gradient.
- Click the 'Save Gradient' button to save the gradient to your browser (this saves to local storage so the gradient can only be viewed on the browser it was saved on).
- Hover on your saved gradient to view the CSS property and click the saved gradient to copy the styling.
